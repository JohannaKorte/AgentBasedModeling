This code accompanies a report that in detail describes the properties of the implemented model and agents.

INSTRUCTIONS
To run the simulation, open separation_main.m in MATLAB and adjust the simulation parameters, like lattice dimensions,
agent minimum and maximum velocity, sight, number of agents, separation goal, number of ticks and number of runs
according to your wishes. Now the only thing remaining is to run separation_main.m with your parameters. 

RESULTS
For each run, a window visualizing the simulation will pop up, with the black dots being the agents, and the blue 
circles around them their separation goal. After a run has ended, the simulation window will close itself, and graphs 
showing regarding number of collisions and conflicts will be shown. Statistics regarding the number of collisions and
number of conflicts will be printed out in the console.
